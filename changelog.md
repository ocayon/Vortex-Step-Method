# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.2.0] - 02/09/2026

Release cut from the `improve_plotting` branch. This is the version used to
generate the rigid-body stability derivatives (Table 8) of Poland et al. (2026),
Wind Energ. Sci., "Computational aerodynamics for soft-wing kite design".

### Fixed
- `BodyAerodynamics.va` setter: the rotational inflow due to body rates is now
  `va -= omega x (r - r0)` (apparent wind = freestream minus body-point velocity).
  v2.1.2 used `+=`, i.e. the body rotating at `-omega`. **This flips the sign of
  every rate derivative** (`d/dp_hat`, `d/dq_hat`, `d/dr_hat`) computed with
  `stability_derivatives.py`; angle derivatives and trim angles are unaffected.
  Roll, pitch and yaw damping derivatives are now negative, as physics requires.
- `stability_derivatives.py::_evaluate_with_angles` now passes `body_axis`, so a
  non-zero baseline roll/pitch rate is no longer silently applied about the z-axis.
- `trim_angle.py`: removed leftover debug `matplotlib` plot/`plt.show()` from the
  coarse sweep (blocked headless pipelines).
- `Filament`: vortex-core regularization uses the radial projection of the
  evaluation point onto the filament.
- `WingGeometry`: section meshing is orientation-agnostic.
- Elliptical-wing y-offset bug in tests fixed; bridle line index handling fixed.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `BodyAerodynamics.va_initialize` / `va` setter no longer accept
  `roll_rate`, `pitch_rate`, `yaw_rate`. Use `body_rates` (scalar or list of
  magnitudes, rad/s), `body_axis` (matching axes, default +z) and
  `rates_in_body_frame`. `compute_trim_angle` and
  `compute_rigid_body_stability_derivatives` keep their `roll_rate/pitch_rate/yaw_rate`
  keyword arguments.
- **Breaking:** bridle-line dictionaries use header key `d` (line diameter)
  instead of `diameter`, matching the SurfPlanAdapter export.
- `BodyAerodynamics.instantiate` accepts `aerodynamic_center_location` and
  `control_point_location` (chord fractions, defaults 0.25 / 0.75); AC and CP
  chord weights are decoupled.
- `Solver`: opt-in Anderson-accelerated inner circulation loop; opt-in
  Li/Gaunaa spanwise artificial viscosity for post-stall stabilization;
  `relaxation_factor` default restored to 0.01.
- `Solver.solve` results include `q_ref` (reference dynamic pressure); coefficients
  are normalised with an area-weighted reference velocity for distributed inflow.
- Quasi-steady-state solver API and examples added and subsequently removed.

### Added
- `BodyAerodynamics.rotate(angle_deg|angle_rad, axis, point)` to rotate the full
  geometry; body rates follow the geometry unless `rates_in_body_frame=True`.
- `BodyAerodynamics.compute_flat_area`.
- `src/VSM/plotly/`: interactive Plotly geometry plots with inflatable tubes,
  curved canopy, Cp-scaled force fields (`fancy_interactive_plot.py` example).
- Examples: `compute_trim_angle.py`, `calculate_max_roll.py`,
  `attitude_and_yaw_rate_optimize.py`, `cmz_sensitivity_default.py`,
  `varying_spanwise_va.py`.
- Tests for gamma initialization, tube geometry, updated filament/solver tests.

## [2.1.0] - 11/02/2026

### Added
- Added extensive new datasets (`555` files) between `v2.0.1` and current `main`, primarily:
  - `data/TUDELFT_V3_KITE` (CAD-derived geometry, 2D/3D polars, validation assets)
  - `data/paraglider_Belloc_2015` (reference data and `FoilsVTK` geometry set)
- Added new examples (`15` files), including:
  - TU Delft scripts: `aoa_correction_test.py`, `compare_against_literature.py`, `plotting_the_geometry.py`, `save_polars.py`, `testing_center_of_pressure_calculation.py`
  - NeuralFoil tutorial and result figures in `examples/neuralfoil/`
  - Belloc comparison scripts in `examples/paraglider_Belloc_2015/`

### Changed
- `Solver`:
  - default `core_radius_fraction` changed from `1e-20` to `0.05`
  - added `is_aoa_corrected` flag and propagated it to the aerodynamic solve path
- `BodyAerodynamics`:
  - center-of-pressure computation updated to use a signed force component (`dot(cross(y_airf, F), z_airf)`) instead of projected-force magnitude fallback logic
  - solve branching now uses `is_aoa_corrected` flag
- `stability_derivatives.py` expanded with aircraft-frame coefficient mapping utilities and a helper to build Malz-style quadratic coefficient tables from solver evaluations
- `plotting.py::plot_polars` updated to compute `CL/CD` directly when plotting against angle of attack
- Example maintenance:
  - renamed `sensivity.py` -> `sensitivity.py`
  - renamed `benchmark.py` -> `benchmark_runtime.py`
  - updated `evaluate_stability_derivatives.py`, `fit_polynomials_polars.py`, and `tutorial.py`

### Fixed
- Improved filament near-singularity handling by replacing exact `== 0` checks with tolerance-based checks (`< 1e-12 * epsilon`) in bound, trailing, and semi-infinite filament evaluations.



## [2.0.1] - 21-10-2025

### Added
- `evaluate_stability_derivatives.py` example script demonstrating the use of the new
  `compute_rigid_body_stability_derivatives()` function for calculating aerodynamic stability derivatives, prints results at trim conditions in the kite reference frame (x-backward LE to TE, y-right from kite's perspective, z-up) and in the aircraft convention (x-forward, y-right, z-down).

### Fixed
- Corrected a misplaced minus sign in the sideslip handling inside `BodyAerodynamics.va_initialize`, restoring the intended sign convention for moment predictions and β-related stability derivatives.

## [2.0.0] - 08-10-2025

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

#### API Changes in `BodyAerodynamics`

**1. `va.setter` now requires keyword-only arguments:**

The velocity setter has been completely redesigned to properly handle body angular rates and reference points. All arguments after `va` are now **keyword-only**.

**Old usage (v1.1.0):**
```python
# Setting velocity with yaw rate (tuple format)
body_aero.va = (vel_app, yaw_rate)

# Or without yaw rate
body_aero.va = vel_app
```

**New usage (v2.0.0+):**
```python
# Basic velocity setting (no body rates)
body_aero.va = vel_app

# With body rates (keyword arguments required)
body_aero.va = vel_app, roll_rate=p, pitch_rate=q, yaw_rate=r

# With custom reference point for rotational velocity
body_aero.va = vel_app, yaw_rate=r, reference_point=np.array([x, y, z])
```

**Migration guide:**
- Instead of setting it directly using `body_aero.va`, you can instead use `va_initialize()` (see below)

- If you do want to directly set it, you could should write for full control over body rates:
  ```python
  body_aero.va = vel_app, roll_rate=p, pitch_rate=q, yaw_rate=r, reference_point=ref_pt
  ```

**2. `va_initialize()` signature expanded:**

The initialization method now accepts body angular rates and reference point.

**Old signature (v1.1.0):**
```python
body_aero.va_initialize(Umag, angle_of_attack, side_slip, yaw_rate=0.0)
```

**New signature (v2.0.0+):**
```python
body_aero.va_initialize(
    Umag, 
    angle_of_attack, 
    side_slip, 
    pitch_rate=0.0,      # NEW
    roll_rate=0.0,       # NEW  
    reference_point=None # NEW
)
```

**Migration guide:**
- The `yaw_rate` parameter has been **removed**
- Body rates are now specified via `pitch_rate`, `roll_rate` keywords
- If you need yaw rate, use `pitch_rate` parameter (body-fixed z-axis)
- Most existing code will work without changes if you weren't using `yaw_rate`
- If you were using `yaw_rate`, replace with appropriate body rate:
  ```python
  # Old
  body_aero.va_initialize(Umag, alpha, beta, yaw_rate=0.5)
  
  # New (yaw is rotation about body z-axis = pitch_rate)
  body_aero.va_initialize(Umag, alpha, beta, pitch_rate=0.5)
  ```

**3. Rotational velocity calculation changed:**

The method for computing rotational velocity contributions has been fundamentally updated:

- **Old behavior:** Simple uniform yaw rate applied
- **New behavior:** Proper rotational velocity field: `v_rot = omega × (r - r_ref)`
  - Accounts for all three body angular rates (roll, pitch, yaw)
  - Reference point can be specified (defaults to panel centroids)
  - Physically accurate velocity field due to body rotation

**Impact:**
- Results involving body angular rates will differ from v1.1.0
- New results are physically more accurate
- If comparing with v1.1.0 results, expect differences in cases with non-zero angular rates

**4. New property: `_body_rates`**

Body angular rates are now stored and accessible via `_body_rates` property:
```python
p, q, r = body_aero._body_rates  # [roll_rate, pitch_rate, yaw_rate]
```
