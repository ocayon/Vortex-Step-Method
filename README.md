# Vortex Step Method
The Vortex Step Method (VSM) is an enhanced lifting line method that improves upon the classic approach by solving the circulation system at the three-quarter chord position. This adjustment allows for more accurate calculations of lift and drag forces, particularly addressing the shortcomings in induced drag prediction. VSM is further refined by coupling it with 2D viscous airfoil polars, making it well-suited for complex geometries, including low aspect ratio wings, as well as configurations with sweep, dihedral, and anhedral angles, typical for leading-edge inflatable (LEI) kites, that are used in airborne wind energy production, boat-towing and kite-surfing. 

A Julia version of this project is available at [VortexStepMethod.jl](https://github.com/Albatross-Kite-Transport/VortexStepMethod.jl)


## Key Features
- **Accurate low-aspect-ratio wing modeling** with enhanced lifting line theory
- **Viscous-inviscid coupling** using 2D airfoil polars (inviscid, CFD, ML-based)
- **Complex geometry support**: sweep, dihedral, anhedral, leading-edge inflatable (LEI) kites
- **Rigid-body stability derivatives**: automatic computation of dCx/dα, dCMy/dq, etc.
- **Trim angle solver**: automatic determination of trimmed angle of attack
- **Non-dimensional rate derivatives**: controls-friendly output (hat_p, hat_q, hat_r)
- **Reference point flexibility**: correctly handles moment reference point for rotational velocities
- **Interactive visualization**: Plotly and Matplotlib geometry and results plotting

## Reference Frame

The VSM uses a body-fixed reference frame with the following conventions:

**Coordinate Axes:**
- **x-axis**: Rearward (leading edge → trailing edge)
- **y-axis**: Right wing (when looking from behind the kite)
- **z-axis**: Upward (from wing tip to mid-span)

**Aerodynamic Angles:**
- **Angle of Attack (α)**: Positive for nose up
- **Sideslip (β)**: Positive for wind from the left/port side (positive Vy)

**Body Rotation Rates** (right-hand rule):
- **Roll rate (p)**: Positive for left wing down (counter-clockwise looking forward)
- **Pitch rate (q)**: Positive for nose up (clockwise looking from right wing)
- **Yaw rate (r)**: Positive for nose left (counter-clockwise looking down)

The reference frame is illustrated below for the open-source example kite, the [TU Delft V3 Kite](https://awegroup.github.io/TUDELFT_V3_KITE/).

**Aircraft Frame Transformation:** For stability derivatives in standard aircraft coordinates (x-forward, y-right, z-down), use `map_derivatives_to_aircraft_frame()` from the `VSM.stability_derivatives` module. See `examples/TUDELFT_V3_KITE/evaluate_stability_derivatives.py` for usage.

**Machine Learning**

The code base is adapted to work with a machine learning model trained on more than a hundred thousands Reynolds-average Navier Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations made for leading-edge inflatable airfoils, documented in the MSc. thesis of [K.R.G. Masure](https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:865d59fc-ccff-462e-9bac-e81725f1c0c9), the [code base is also open-source accessible](https://github.com/awegroup/Pointwise-Openfoam-toolchain).

As the three trained models, for Reynolds number = 1e6, 5e6 and 1e7 are too large (~2.3GB) for GitHub, they have to be downloaded separately, and added to the `data/ml_models` folder. They are accessible through [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16925758), and so is the [CFD data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16925833) on which the models are trained. More description on its usage is found in [Airfoil Aerodynamics](docs/AirfoilAerodynamics.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors with numba:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade numba
```

**Matplotlib backend issues on Linux:**
```bash
export MPLBACKEND=TkAgg  # Or 'Qt5Agg' if PyQt5 installed
```

**Missing ML models:**
Download from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16925758) and place in `data/ml_models/`

**Plotly not showing in Jupyter:**
```bash
pip install jupyterlab "ipywidgets>=7.5"
```
