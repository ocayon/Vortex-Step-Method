# Vortex_step_method
Implementation of the Vortex Step Method for a static wing shape

# functions_VSM_LLT.py

Contains all the necessary functions to solve the aerodynamics of the wing with both the Vortex Step Method [1,2] and the classic Lifting Line Theory.

# main.py

Script to solve for one angle of attack
INPUTS:
- Coordinates of the wing (look at the rectangular wing example). 
The coordinates are defined so that the first point is the LE position of the first section, the second point the TE of the first section and so on. 
- Convergence criteria
- Velocity magnitude and direction
- Number of filaments per horseshoe
- Model : 'VSM' or 'LLT'
- Airfoil polars
